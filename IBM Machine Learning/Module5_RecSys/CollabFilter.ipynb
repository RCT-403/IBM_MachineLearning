As hinted by its alternate name, this technique uses other users to recommend items to the input user. It attempts to find users that have similar preferences and opinions as the input and then recommends items that they have liked to the input. There are several methods of finding similar users (Even some making use of Machine Learning), and the one we will be using here is going to be based on the __Pearson Correlation Function__.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%205/images/User_Item.png\" width=\"800px\">\n","\n","\n","The process for creating a User Based recommendation system is as follows:\n","- Select a user with the movies the user has watched\n","- Based on his rating of the movies, find the top X neighbours \n","- Get the watched movie record of the user for each neighbour\n","- Calculate a similarity score using some formula\n","- Recommend the items with the highest score\n","\n","\n","Let's begin by creating an input user to recommend movies to:\n","\n","Notice: To add more movies, simply increase the amount of elements in the userInput.
